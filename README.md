Finally an EV companion app that is not sluggish and slow wrapper around a poorly designed website. SparkMap enables you to easily find charging stations in your area or anywhere else in the world. Filtering features lets you pick what kind of chargers you are interested in and the offline option is there to save you if you're concerned about data usage. 

SparkMap offers a smooth and responsive Apple Maps based experience and 3D Touch lets you peek and pop charging station details. 

Say goodbye to agonizingly poor charging station apps and say hello to an app done right! Say hello to SparkMap!
